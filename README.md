## Philosophy

In recent years, many companies rely on predictable password patterns and predefined text formats to streamline access and file generation processes. While this practice can simplify management, it also poses security risks.

Under the hood, wordlist-maker makes use of [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templating engine, which allows it to dynamically generate text files based on customizable templates and structured data. This means that users can create complex, rule-based password lists or text files in various formats by simply defining mustaches and data inputs.
